RAM usage, on the other hand, shows a more consistent pattern, generally staying within the range of 2-35%.","1. The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN values) for all the entries, which indicates missing or incomplete information about disk io usage.

2. The CPU usage shows significant fluctuations, with the highest value being 88.4% on 222-8-5 and the lowest value being 2.29% on 222-8-21.

3. The RAM usage also varies throughout the dataset, with the highest value being 35.26% on 222-8-2 and the lowest value being 2.95% on 222-8-6."
