      "insight_1": "1. High CPU Usage: The highest CPU usage recorded was 84.62% on August 15th, followed by 84.56% on August 8th. These high CPU usage instances might indicate heavy processing tasks or potential performance issues.\n\n2. RAM Usage Trend: The RAM usage generally stayed above 4%, with the highest RAM usage of 67.36% on August 8th. This suggests that the computer consistently consumes a significant amount of memory resources.\n\n3. Missing Disk IO Usage Data: The diskio_usage data is missing (NaN) for all the entries in the given dataset. This makes it impossible to analyze disk input/output performance and identify potential bottlenecks or issues related to disk usage.",

Low CPU usage: On 222-8-22, the CPU usage was considerably lower than the rest of the days, with a value of 11.277125.\n\n3. Missing diskio_usage data: The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN) for all the entries in the dataset, indicating that this information is missing or not recorded."
