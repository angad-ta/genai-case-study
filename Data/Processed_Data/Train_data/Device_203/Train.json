This could indicate that the user is running resource-intensive applications or has insufficient RAM for their needs.\n\n2. Peak RAM Usage: The highest RAM usage recorded is 98.398824% on 8/7/222, which is very close to the maximum capacity. This could lead to performance issues or crashes if not addressed.\n\n3. Lowest RAM Usage: The lowest RAM usage recorded is 76.91455% on 7/2/222. Even at its lowest point, the RAM usage is still relatively high, reinforcing the need for the user to consider upgrading their RAM or optimizing their applications.",

The second-highest RAM usage of 98.195% occurred on 5/3/222.\n3. The third-highest RAM usage of 97.818248% was observed on 7/14/222."
