The RAM usage showed an increasing trend throughout the month, with the lowest usage of 38.48% on August 1st and the highest usage of 52.91% on August 15th.\n\n3. Disk IO usage data is missing for the entire month, making it impossible to analyze and draw insights from this metric.",

Inconsistent data collection frequency: The data is not collected consistently on a daily basis, as there are gaps between some dates (e.g., August 3rd to 8th, August 16th to 19th, and August 2th to 22nd)."
