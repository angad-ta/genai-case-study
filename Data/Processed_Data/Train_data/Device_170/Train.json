This could indicate a period of high disk activity or a potential issue with the system.\n\n2. High RAM Usage: The RAM usage is consistently high throughout the month, with the lowest usage being 41.35923 on 223-3-6 and the highest usage reaching 97.793383 on 223-3-19. This could suggest that the computer is running memory-intensive applications or may require a RAM upgrade.\n\n3. CPU Usage Fluctuations: The CPU usage fluctuates throughout the month, with the lowest usage at 8.337 on 223-3-6 and the highest usage at 35.259897 on 223-3-16. This could indicate varying workloads or potential performance issues on certain days.",
