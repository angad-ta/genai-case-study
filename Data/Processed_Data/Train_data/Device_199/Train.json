The highest RAM usage occurred on August 11th, 222, at 57.7%. This is also considerably higher than the average RAM usage for the month, suggesting that the user may have been running memory-intensive applications or processes on that day.\n\n3.

This indicates that there might be an issue with data collection or reporting for this metric, which needs to be addressed to gain insights into disk usage patterns.",

Missing diskio_usage data: The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN) for all the entries in the dataset, indicating that this information is missing or not recorded."
