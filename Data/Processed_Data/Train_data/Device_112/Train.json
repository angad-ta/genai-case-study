Significant increase in CPU usage: There is a noticeable increase in CPU usage towards the end of the month, with the highest usage of 64.15% on March 31st, which is significantly higher than the average usage in the earlier days of the month.\n\n2. High RAM usage in the last week: The RAM usage shows a considerable increase in the last week of March, with the highest usage of 74.51% on March 29th. This is a substantial increase compared to the usage in the first three weeks of the month, which ranged between 33.96% and 5.38%.\n\n3. Disk IO usage remains relatively stable: Throughout the month, the disk IO usage remains relatively stable, with no significant spikes or drops. The highest disk IO usage is 2.32% on March 3th, and the lowest is 1.57% on March 1th.",
