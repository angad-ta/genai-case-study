      "insight_1": "1. The highest CPU usage was recorded on 223-3-14 at 43.18%, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage across all days. This could indicate a particularly resource-intensive task or application running on that day.\n\n2. The RAM usage shows a significant drop on 223-3-6 at 27.1%, which is much lower than the average RAM usage across all days. This could suggest that fewer applications were running or the user was performing less resource-intensive tasks on that day.\n\n3. The disk IO usage experienced a notable spike on 223-3-28 at 9.62%, which is considerably higher than the average disk IO usage across all days. This could be due to increased file transfers, software installations, or other disk-intensive activities on that day.",

On 223-3-22, CPU usage (29.44%) and disk IO usage (5.65%) are notably higher than the days before and after.\n3. On 223-3-28, CPU usage (31.8%) and disk IO usage (9.62%) are again considerably higher than the surrounding dates."
