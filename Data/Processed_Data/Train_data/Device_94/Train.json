This indicates that the computer experienced the heaviest workload on this day.\n\n2. The average CPU usage throughout the month was relatively low, with most days having CPU usage below 15%. However, there were four days with significantly higher CPU usage: 223-3-1 (38.98%), 223-3-2 (29.48%), 223-3-14 (13.52%), and 223-3-15 (13.98%). These days may have involved more intensive tasks or applications.\n\n3. The RAM usage remained consistently high throughout the month, with an average usage of around 67%. This suggests that the computer may benefit from additional RAM to handle the workload more efficiently.",
      "insight_2": "1. The highest CPU usage was recorded on 223-3-1, with a value of 38.98%, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage in the dataset.\n2. The highest RAM usage occurred on 223-3-31, with a value of 75.53%, which is noticeably higher than the average RAM usage in the dataset.\n3. The highest disk IO usage was observed on 223-3-1, with a value of 28.92%, which is considerably higher than the average disk IO usage in the dataset."
