These spikes are much higher compared to the rest of the days in March 223.\n\n2. High RAM usage: The RAM usage is consistently high throughout the month, with the highest usage on 223-3-18 (79.27%). The lowest RAM usage is on 223-3-24 (43.87%), which is an outlier compared to the rest of the month.\n\n3.
