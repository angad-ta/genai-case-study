Significant increase in CPU usage: There is a noticeable jump in CPU usage starting from 223-3-16, with values around 61-63%, compared to the previous days where the CPU usage was around 9-12%. This indicates a potential change in the user's computer activity or a new application consuming more resources.\n\n2. RAM usage trend: The RAM usage shows fluctuating values from 223-3-1 to 223-3-15, with usage ranging from 4.11% to 46.14%. However, after 223-3-15, the RAM usage decreases and stabilizes around 31-39%. This could be due to the user closing some applications or freeing up memory.\n\n3. Disk IO usage remains stable: Throughout the entire period, the disk IO usage remains relatively stable, with values ranging from 1.1% to 1.53%. This indicates that the user's disk activity has not changed significantly during this time.",
