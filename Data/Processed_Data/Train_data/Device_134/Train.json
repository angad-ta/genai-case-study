This could indicate an unusual event or high workload on that day.\n\n2. The RAM usage remains relatively stable throughout the month, with an average of around 38.3%. However, there is a noticeable increase in RAM usage on 223-3-5 (46.19%) and 223-3-14 to 223-3-22 (ranging from 4.79% to 43.51%), which could be related to the spike in CPU usage on 223-3-5.\n\n3. Disk IO usage is generally low and stable throughout the month, with an average of around 1.3%. However, there is a noticeable increase in disk IO usage on 223-3-8 (1.76%) and 223-3-14 (1.74%), which might be worth investigating for potential causes.",

On 223-3-6, the CPU usage is at 24.39%, which is also higher than the average but not as extreme as the spike on 223-3-5.\n3. On 223-3-14, the disk io usage is at 1.74%, which is higher than the average disk io usage observed in the dataset."
