This indicates that the computer might be running memory-intensive applications or requires a RAM upgrade.\n\n2. CPU Usage Fluctuations: The CPU usage shows significant fluctuations, ranging from as low as 6.21% to as high as 77.11%. This suggests that the computer's workload varies greatly from day to day, possibly due to different tasks or applications being used.\n\n3. Missing Disk IO Usage Data: The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN) for all the entries. This information is crucial for understanding the overall performance of the computer and should be collected and analyzed in future reports.",

High RAM usage: The highest RAM usage recorded is 93.49% on 222-8-6, followed by 93.47% on 222-8-18, 92.33% on 222-8-17 and 91.88% on 222-8-16.\n\n3. Missing diskio_usage data: The diskio_usage column has NaN values for all the entries, indicating that the data is missing or not recorded."
