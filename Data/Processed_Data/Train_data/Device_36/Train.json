The highest RAM usage occurred on March 24, 223, with a value of 65.34%. This is the only instance where RAM usage exceeded 6% during the given period.\n\n3. The highest disk IO usage was also observed on March 28, 223, with a value of 11.12%. This day had both the highest CPU and disk IO usage, indicating a possible high workload or resource-intensive task being performed on that day.",

On 223-3-28, the disk io usage also shows an unusual increase at 11.122186, which is notably higher compared to other days.\n\n3. On 223-3-24, the RAM usage reaches its highest value at 65.339139, which is an aberration compared to the general RAM usage trend in the dataset."
