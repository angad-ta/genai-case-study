There is a significant variation in CPU usage throughout the month.\n\n2. RAM Usage: The RAM usage consistently stayed above 29% throughout the month, with the highest usage of 72.3% on 223-3-28. This indicates that the computer is frequently using a significant portion of its RAM.\n\n3. Disk IO Usage: The highest disk IO usage was recorded on 223-3-17 with 5.3%, while the lowest was on 223-3-31 with 1.1%. Disk IO usage also shows variation, but it is less pronounced compared to CPU usage.",

On 223-3-8, the RAM usage drops significantly to 48.99% compared to the previous day (7.9%), while the disk IO usage increases to a high value (4.56%).\n\n3. On 223-3-28, the CPU usage reaches its peak value (23.68%) in the dataset, accompanied by the highest RAM usage (72.3%) and a high disk IO usage (3.65%)."
