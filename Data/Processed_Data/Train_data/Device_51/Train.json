The highest RAM usage occurred on 223-3-25 at 61.12%, indicating a possible increase in resource-intensive tasks on that day.\n3. The highest disk IO usage was observed on 223-3-21 at 11.16%, which is considerably higher than the average disk IO usage, suggesting increased read/write operations on that day.",

This spike also coincides with a high disk IO usage of 9.95%.\n\n2. On 223-3-21, the disk IO usage reaches its peak at 11.16%, which is significantly higher than the average disk IO usage in the dataset.\n\n3. On 223-3-31, there is an unusually low CPU usage of 3.88% and RAM usage of 29.76%, which are both significantly lower than the average values in the dataset."
