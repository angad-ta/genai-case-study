      "insight_1": "1. On 223-3-21, there was a significant spike in CPU usage (39.39%) and Disk IO usage (37.52%), which is much higher than the average values observed in the given data. This indicates that there might have been an unusual event or heavy processing task on this day.\n\n2. The RAM usage remains consistently high throughout the month, with an average of around 75%. This suggests that the computer might be running memory-intensive applications or could benefit from a RAM upgrade to improve performance.\n\n3. The Disk IO usage shows considerable variation, with the lowest value of 3.8% on 223-3-3 and the highest value of 37.52% on 223-3-21. This indicates that the computer's disk usage is not consistent and could be influenced by specific tasks or applications that require more disk access.",

This could indicate an unusual event or heavy processing task on that day.\n\n2. The RAM usage remains consistently high throughout the month, ranging between 59.21% and 82.71%. This could indicate that the computer is running memory-intensive applications or has insufficient RAM to handle its workload.\n\n3. On 223-3-3, the disk IO usage drops to its lowest value of 3.8%, which is significantly lower than the average disk IO usage observed on other days. This could indicate a decrease in disk activity or a potential issue with the disk on that day."
