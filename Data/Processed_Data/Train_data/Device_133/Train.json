      "insight_1": "1. The highest CPU usage was recorded on 223-3-5 at 88.4%, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage for the month. This could indicate a high workload or a resource-intensive task being performed on that day.\n\n2. The highest disk IO usage occurred on 223-3-27 at 37.99%, which is considerably higher than the average disk IO usage for the month. This suggests that there might have been a large file transfer or a disk-intensive operation on that day.\n\n3. The RAM usage remained consistently high throughout the month, with the lowest usage at 8.8% on 223-3-2 and the highest at 86.12% on 223-3-4. This indicates that the computer might be running multiple applications or processes that require a significant amount of memory, and it could benefit from a RAM upgrade to improve performance.",

Highest Disk IO usage: On 223-3-27, the disk IO usage spiked to 37.99%, which is considerably higher than the average disk IO usage in the dataset.\n\n3. Lowest CPU usage: On 223-3-31, the CPU usage dropped to its lowest point at 35.9%, which is significantly lower than the average CPU usage observed in the dataset."
