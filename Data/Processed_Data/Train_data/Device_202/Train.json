Missing diskio_usage values: All the diskio_usage values in the dataset are NaN, indicating missing or incomplete data for this field.\n\n2. High RAM usage: The RAM usage is consistently high, ranging from 68.7% to 84.64%. This could indicate a potential issue with the computer's memory management or a resource-intensive application running on the system.\n\n3. CPU usage fluctuations: The CPU usage varies significantly across the dataset, with values ranging from 11.74% to 31.59%. This fluctuation might indicate inconsistent workload or performance issues on the computer."
