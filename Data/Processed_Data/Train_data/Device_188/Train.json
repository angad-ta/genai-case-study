The highest CPU usage (49.54%) occurred on 223-3-14, the highest RAM usage (9.35%) on 223-3-8, and the highest Disk IO usage (44.67%) on 223-3-14.\n\n2. The average CPU, RAM, and Disk IO usages for the given period are 22.14%, 87.34%, and 12.63% respectively. This indicates that the computer consistently experiences high RAM usage, while CPU and Disk IO usages are relatively lower.\n\n3. There is a significant spike in Disk IO usage on 223-3-14 (44.67%), which is more than 3 times the average Disk IO usage (12.63%). This suggests that there might have been an unusual event or activity on this date that caused the increase in Disk IO usage.",

On 223-3-17, the RAM usage drops to 79.97%, which is considerably lower than the average RAM usage observed in the dataset.\n\n3. On 223-3-14, there is a noticeable increase in CPU usage (49.5%) and disk IO usage (44.6%) compared to the surrounding dates."
