      "insight_2": "1. Missing Data: The 'diskio_usage' column has missing (NaN) values for all the entries in the dataset. This indicates that there might be an issue with data collection or recording for this particular field.\n\n2. CPU Usage Spike: On 222-8-29, there is a significant spike in CPU usage (8.15%) compared to the rest of the dataset. This could indicate an unusual event or high resource demand on that particular day.\n\n3. Low CPU Usage: On 222-8-13, the CPU usage is significantly lower (7.66%) compared to the rest of the dataset. This could indicate a period of low activity or a potential issue with the computer's performance on that day."
