Significant increase in CPU usage: There is a noticeable increase in CPU usage towards the end of the month, with the highest values being 4.66%, 43.72%, and 4.25% on March 29th, 3th, and 31st, respectively. This is a substantial jump compared to the average CPU usage earlier in the month.\n\n2. Consistently high RAM usage: Throughout the month, RAM usage remains relatively high, with an average of around 76%. This indicates that the computer is consistently utilizing a significant portion of its memory resources.\n\n3. Disk IO usage spike: Similar to CPU usage, there is a considerable increase in disk IO usage towards the end of the month, with values of 6.67%, 5.83%, and 6.17% on March 29th, 3th, and 31st, respectively. This suggests that the computer is experiencing higher disk activity during this period.",
