This indicates a significant variation in CPU usage over the given period.\n\n2. RAM usage consistently stayed above 5% throughout the entire period, with the highest RAM usage at 73.45% on 223-3-24. This suggests that the computer might be running memory-intensive applications or processes.\n\n3. Disk IO usage remained relatively low compared to CPU and RAM usage, with the highest value at 12.34% on 223-3-13. This indicates that disk-intensive tasks were not as common during the given period.",

Low disk IO usage on 223-3-27: The disk IO usage on this date is exceptionally low at .22% compared to other dates, where the usage ranges between .48% and 12.34%.\n\n3. High RAM usage on 223-3-24: The RAM usage on this date is the highest at 73.45% compared to other dates, where the usage ranges between 53.12% and 7.48%."
