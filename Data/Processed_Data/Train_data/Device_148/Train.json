The user's CPU usage varies significantly, with the highest usage at 26.52% on 222-8-12 and the lowest at 5.11% on 222-8-14. This indicates that the user's computer usage patterns might be inconsistent or involve different types of tasks.\n\n3. The RAM usage generally stays above 44%, with the highest usage at 58.13% on 222-8-13 and the lowest at 44.9% on 222-8-15. This suggests that the user's computer consistently consumes a significant portion of its RAM, possibly due to running multiple applications or resource-intensive tasks.",

CPU Usage Variation: The CPU usage varies significantly, with the lowest value being 5.11% on 222-8-14 and the highest value being 26.52% on 222-8-12. This indicates that the computer's CPU usage is not consistent and may require further investigation.\n\n3. RAM Usage Variation: The RAM usage also shows considerable variation, with the lowest value being 44.9% on 222-8-15 and the highest value being 58.13% on 222-8-13. This suggests that the computer's RAM usage is not stable and may need further analysis."
