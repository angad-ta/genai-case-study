These spikes in CPU usage may indicate resource-intensive tasks or applications running on those days.\n\n2. Consistently High RAM Usage: The RAM usage remains consistently high throughout the month, ranging from 27.12% to 47.2%. This could suggest that the user is running memory-intensive applications or has insufficient RAM for their needs.\n\n3. Missing Disk IO Usage Data: The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN) for all the entries. This information is crucial for understanding the overall performance of the computer and should be collected and analyzed in the future.",
      "insight_2": "1. High CPU usage: On 222-8-3, the CPU usage reached its highest value of 57.97%, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage observed in the dataset.\n\n2. Missing diskio_usage data: The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN) for all the entries in the dataset, indicating that this information is missing or not recorded.\n\n3. Sudden increase in CPU usage: On 222-8-9, there is a sudden increase in CPU usage from 11.55% (222-8-8) to 55.69%, which is an unusual spike compared to the surrounding data points."
