      "insight_1": "1. High RAM Usage: The RAM usage is consistently high throughout the month, with the lowest value being 46.91% on March 29th and the highest value being 9.5% on March 1st. On average, the RAM usage is above 8%, which indicates that the computer might be running memory-intensive applications or requires a RAM upgrade.\n\n2. CPU Usage Variability: The CPU usage varies significantly throughout the month, with the lowest value being 5.52% on March 29th and the highest value being 22.87% on March 1st. This suggests that the computer's workload is not consistent and may require optimization or better resource management.\n\n3. Low Disk IO Usage: The disk IO usage is relatively low compared to CPU and RAM usage, with the highest value being 12.26% on March 1th and the lowest value being 1.33% on March 27th. This indicates that the computer's disk performance is not a bottleneck and is functioning efficiently.",
      "insight_2": "1. Highest CPU usage: On 223-3-1, the CPU usage reached its peak at 22.874618, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage observed in the dataset.\n\n2. Lowest RAM usage: On 223-3-29, the RAM usage dropped to its lowest point at 46.9111, which is considerably lower than the average RAM usage observed in the dataset.\n\n3. Highest Disk IO usage: On 223-3-1, the disk IO usage reached its highest value at 12.257881, which is significantly higher than the average disk IO usage observed in the dataset."
