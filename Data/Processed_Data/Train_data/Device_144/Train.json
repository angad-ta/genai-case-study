The highest CPU usage for the user 'ac187ec5f7' was recorded on 222-8-16 at 7.94%, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage during the given period.\n\n3. Disk IO usage data is missing (NaN) for all the entries in the table, indicating a potential issue with data collection or reporting for this metric.",

CPU Usage Spike: On 222-8-16, there is a significant spike in CPU usage (7.94276) compared to the other dates. This could indicate an unusual event or increased workload on that day.\n\n3. RAM Usage Decrease: On 222-8-29, there is a noticeable decrease in RAM usage (8.6598) compared to the previous dates. This could suggest a change in the user's activities or system configuration."
