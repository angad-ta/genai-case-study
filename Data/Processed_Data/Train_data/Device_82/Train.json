      "insight_1": "1. High RAM Usage: The RAM usage is consistently high throughout the month, ranging from 78.13% to 88.98%. This indicates that the computer might be running memory-intensive applications or requires a RAM upgrade for better performance.\n\n2. Low CPU Usage: The CPU usage is relatively low, with the highest value being 4.17% and the lowest at .82%. This suggests that the computer's processor is not being heavily utilized and may have the capacity to handle more tasks.\n\n3. Missing Disk IO Usage Data: The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN) for all the entries. This means that the information about disk input/output usage is not available, which could be crucial for understanding the overall performance of the computer.",
      "insight_2": "1. Missing Disk IO Usage: The diskio_usage column has NaN values for all the entries, indicating that the data is missing or not recorded.\n\n2. High RAM Usage: The ram_usage column shows consistently high values, ranging from 78.13% to 88.98%, which might indicate a potential issue with the computer's memory management or a resource-intensive application running on the system.\n\n3. CPU Usage Variability: The cpu_usage column has values ranging from .82% to 4.17%, showing significant variability in CPU usage over the given period. This could be due to varying workloads or processes running on the computer during different days."
