This could indicate a change in the user's computer usage pattern or a potential issue with the computer.\n\n2. Consistent Disk IO usage: Throughout the entire month, the disk IO usage remains at .. This could mean that either the user is not performing any disk-intensive tasks or there might be an issue with the data collection for disk IO usage.\n\n3. RAM usage fluctuations: The RAM usage fluctuates between 27.75% and 49.23% during the month, with the highest usage on 223-3-1 and the lowest on 223-3-31. This suggests that the user's computer usage varies, possibly due to different types of tasks being performed on different days.",
