      "insight_1": "1. The highest CPU, RAM, and Disk IO usages were recorded on 223-3-15, with values of 36.13%, 96.29%, and 59.68% respectively. This indicates that the computer experienced its peak usage on this day.\n\n2. The average CPU usage across the entire period is 21.34%, while the average RAM usage is 9.97%. This suggests that the computer's RAM is consistently utilized at a high level, whereas the CPU usage is relatively moderate.\n\n3. There is a noticeable drop in CPU, RAM, and Disk IO usages between 223-3-16 and 223-3-19. The CPU usage decreased from 28.88% to 23.26%, RAM usage from 95.72% to 91.99%, and Disk IO usage from 36.98% to 18.99%. This could indicate a period of reduced activity or system maintenance.",

This indicates an unusual high resource consumption on this day.\n\n2. On 223-3-16, while the CPU usage (28.88%) and RAM usage (95.72%) are still relatively high, the disk IO usage (36.98%) has dropped significantly compared to the previous day (223-3-15). This suggests a change in the nature of tasks being performed on the computer.\n\n3. Between 223-3-19 and 223-3-24, there is a noticeable decrease in RAM usage, with the lowest value being 84.75% on 223-3-24. This period shows a deviation from the consistently high RAM usage observed in the rest of the dataset."
