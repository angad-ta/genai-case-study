The highest CPU usage was recorded on 222-8-12 with a value of 13.119225, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage for the given period.\n\n3. The RAM usage shows an overall increasing trend throughout the month of August, with the highest RAM usage recorded on 222-8-23 at 69.898849. This could indicate that the user's computer might be running more resource-intensive tasks or applications over time.",

CPU Usage Spike: On 222-8-12, there is a significant increase in CPU usage (13.119225) compared to the surrounding dates, which could indicate an unusual event or activity on that day.\n\n3. RAM Usage Increase: Between 222-8-1 and 222-8-19, the RAM usage shows a steady increase from 58.576579 to 69.195521. This could be due to increased workload or memory leaks in the system."
