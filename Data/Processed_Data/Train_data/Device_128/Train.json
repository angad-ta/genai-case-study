Consistently low disk IO usage: The disk IO usage remains at .% for the entire period, indicating that there might be no disk-intensive tasks or an issue with the data collection.\n\n3. CPU usage trend: The CPU usage generally stays below 13%, with the highest usage at 12.7% on 223-3-17 and the lowest at 1.99% on 223-3-19. This suggests that the computer is not being heavily utilized in terms of processing power during this period.",
