The peak usage occurs on March 28th with 54.75% CPU usage, 91.21% RAM usage, and 8.69% Disk IO usage.\n\n2. High RAM usage throughout the month: The RAM usage remains consistently high, ranging from 53.76% to 98.4%. This indicates that the computer might be running memory-intensive applications or processes during this period.\n\n3. Lower resource usage at the beginning and end of the month: The CPU, RAM, and Disk IO usage are relatively lower during the first week (March 1st to March 7th) and the last few days (March 29th to March 31st) of the month. This could suggest a pattern of lower workload or less intensive tasks during these periods.",

On 223-3-27, there is a notable increase in CPU usage (3.68%) and Disk IO usage (58.1%) compared to the previous days.\n3. On 223-3-26, there is a considerable increase in CPU usage (21.7%) and Disk IO usage (22.46%) compared to the previous days."
