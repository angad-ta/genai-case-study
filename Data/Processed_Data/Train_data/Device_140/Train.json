The highest disk IO usage occurred on March 27, 223, with a value of 38.46%. This is an outlier compared to the rest of the days, as the second-highest disk IO usage is only 11.42% on March 28, 223.\n\n3. The RAM usage remained relatively stable throughout the month, with an average of around 72%. The highest RAM usage was observed on March 22, 223, at 75.17%, while the lowest was on March 2, 223, at 67.38%.",

On 223-3-27, the disk io usage reached an unusually high value of 38.46%, which is much higher than the average disk io usage in the dataset.\n3. On 223-3-28, the disk io usage was 11.41%, which is also notably higher than the average disk io usage observed in the dataset."
