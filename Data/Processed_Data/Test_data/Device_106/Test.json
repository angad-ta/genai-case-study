This indicates that the computer was under heavy load on this day, possibly running resource-intensive tasks.\n\n2. Consistently High RAM Usage: The RAM usage remains consistently high throughout the month, ranging from 6.97% to 87.1%. This suggests that the computer may have insufficient memory to handle the user's regular tasks, leading to potential performance issues.\n\n3. Missing Disk IO Usage Data: The diskio_usage column has no data (NaN) for all the entries. This indicates that there might be an issue with data collection or reporting for this metric. It is essential to investigate and resolve this issue to gain insights into disk performance.",
