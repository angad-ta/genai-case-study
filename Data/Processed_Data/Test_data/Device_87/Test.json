This indicates that the computer was under heavy load on this day.\n\n2. The lowest RAM usage was observed on 223-3-9, with 55.96% usage. This suggests that the computer had relatively less workload or more efficient memory management on this day.\n\n3. There is a significant variation in CPU usage across the days, ranging from 9.83% to 46.1%. This indicates that the computer's workload and processing requirements fluctuate considerably over time.",
      "insight_2": "1. On 223-3-7, there is a significant spike in CPU usage (46.1%), RAM usage (89.21%), and disk IO usage (14.21%) compared to the surrounding dates. This indicates a possible high workload or system-intensive task being performed on that day.\n\n2. On 223-3-8, there is a noticeable drop in RAM usage (57.92%) compared to the previous day (89.21%). This suggests that the high workload or system-intensive task from the previous day has been completed or stopped.\n\n3. On 223-3-18, the disk IO usage (8.12%) is considerably higher than the surrounding dates, while the CPU usage (2.78%) and RAM usage (74.52%) remain relatively stable. This could indicate a data-intensive task being performed on that day, such as file transfers or backups."
