      "insight_2": "1. Missing Data: The 'diskio_usage' column has missing (NaN) values for all the entries in the dataset. This could lead to inaccurate analysis and insights.\n\n2. CPU Usage Variation: The CPU usage varies significantly across the dates, with the highest usage being 25.2% on 222-8-22 and the lowest usage being 9.3% on 222-8-12. This indicates that the computer's CPU usage is not consistent and may require further investigation.\n\n3. RAM Usage Variation: The RAM usage also shows considerable variation, with the highest usage being 6.11% on 222-8-29 and the lowest usage being 43.28% on 222-8-12. This suggests that the computer's RAM usage is not stable and may need to be looked into."
