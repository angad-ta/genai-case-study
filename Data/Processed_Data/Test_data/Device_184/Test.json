The highest CPU usage (15.51%) occurred on 223-3-27, the highest RAM usage (43.4%) on the same date, and the highest Disk IO usage (4.88%) on 223-3-6.\n\n2. The average CPU, RAM, and Disk IO usages for the given period are 1.54%, 32.97%, and 8.63% respectively. This indicates that, on average, the computer's resources were moderately utilized during this time.\n\n3. There is a noticeable increase in CPU and RAM usage on 223-3-27, with both values reaching their highest points. This suggests that there might have been a resource-intensive task or application running on that day.",
