      "insight_1": "1. The highest CPU usage was recorded on 223-3-15 with 39.66%, which is significantly higher than the average CPU usage across all days. This could indicate an unusual event or high workload on that day.\n\n2. The highest disk IO usage occurred on 223-3-21 with 12.67%, which is considerably higher than the average disk IO usage across all days. This might suggest a large file transfer or intensive disk operations on that day.\n\n3. The RAM usage remained relatively stable throughout the month, with the highest RAM usage of 8.21% on 223-3-15 and the lowest RAM usage of 6.99% on 223-3-6. This indicates that the computer's memory usage is consistent and does not experience extreme fluctuations.",

On 223-3-21, the disk io usage reaches 12.67%, which is an unusual increase compared to the disk io usage on other days.\n3. On 223-3-15, the RAM usage is at 8.21%, which is higher than the average RAM usage observed on other days."
